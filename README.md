# finance-analysis
This project explores and visualizes financial loan data to uncover key trends and insights. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the analysis focuses on understanding loan distribution, regional performance, customer employment trends, loan purposes, and funding amounts.



PROBLEM STATEMENT
Key Performance Indicators
1. Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications.
2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount metric.
3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Receive.
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans which will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans.
